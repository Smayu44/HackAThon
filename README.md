How to open the file :-
1. Go to the file 'Hack-A-Thon Program' and copy the text contents.

2. Open a java IDE (BlueJ/Eclipse/Jdeveloper/etc) and create a new project via 'file' menu. (we used BlueJ to program our software so we think this will be the most hassle-free option)

3. Create a new class and name it 'encryption'.

4. Paste the text into the IDE. Compile the program.

5. Run the program.
